# AI Assistant Application - Architecture Design

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the proposed architecture for the cross-platform AI assistant application requested by the user. The goal is to create a robust, scalable, and secure application that runs on Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux, leveraging Flutter for the UI and incorporating advanced AI capabilities, device control, cloud synchronization, and self-updating mechanisms.

The architecture is designed to be modular, allowing for easier development, testing, and future expansion.

## 2. Core Principles

*   **Cross-Platform:** Utilize Flutter for a unified UI codebase across all target platforms.
*   **Modularity:** Separate concerns into distinct modules (UI, Core Logic, AI, Device Control, Data, etc.).
*   **Scalability:** Design components to handle increasing complexity and data volume.
*   **Security:** Prioritize user data protection, secure authentication, and permission management.
*   **Extensibility:** Allow for future integration of new AI models, cloud storage providers, and features.
*   **Offline Capability:** Provide essential functionality even without an internet connection.

**Component Descriptions:**

1.  **UI Layer (Flutter):**
    *   Provides the user interface for interaction (text input, voice input button, chat display, settings).
    *   Built with Flutter for cross-platform consistency.
    *   Communicates with the Core Logic layer.
2.  **Speech Processing (STT/TTS):**
    *   Handles Speech-to-Text (STT) using libraries like `speech_to_text`.
    *   Handles Text-to-Speech (TTS) using libraries like `flutter_tts`.
    *   Integrates with the UI and Core Logic.
3.  **Core Logic / Orchestration:**
    *   The central brain of the application.
    *   Receives processed input (text) from UI/Speech Processing.
    *   Uses Intent Recognition to understand user commands.
    *   Delegates tasks to appropriate modules (AI Engine, Device Control, Data Management).
    *   Manages application state and workflow.
4.  **Intent Recognition:**
    *   Analyzes user input text to determine the user's intent (e.g., ask a question, control device, save note).
    *   Can leverage the AI Engine for more complex natural language understanding.
5.  **AI Engine:**
    *   Handles natural language processing, question answering, text generation, summarization, etc.
    *   **Online Mode:** Connects to powerful cloud-based AI APIs (e.g., Gemini) for advanced capabilities. Requires secure API key management.
    *   **Offline Mode (Optional/Basic):** May utilize smaller, on-device models (e.g., using TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime) for basic tasks like simple Q&A or command parsing when offline. This is resource-intensive and adds complexity.
6.  **Device Control Module:**
    *   Executes commands that interact with the host operating system and other applications.
    *   Requires platform-specific implementations using Flutter Platform Channels to call native code (Kotlin/Java for Android, Swift/Obj-C for iOS, C++/C#/Python for Desktop).
    *   Functionality will vary significantly between platforms due to OS restrictions (especially iOS).
    *   Examples: Opening apps, managing files (within sandbox limits or with specific permissions), controlling media playback, accessing system settings (limited).
    *   Requires careful handling of permissions.
7.  **Data Management Module:**
    *   Manages all application data, including user preferences, conversation history, notes, and cached information.
    *   **Local Storage:** Uses `shared_preferences` for settings and potentially SQLite (`sqflite`) for structured data like conversation history.
    *   **Cloud Storage Sync:** Integrates with cloud storage APIs (starting with Google Drive) to back up and sync data across devices. Designed with an abstract interface to potentially support other providers later.
8.  **Security Module:**
    *   Handles user authentication, likely leveraging OS-level security (biometrics, passcode) via plugins like `local_auth`.
    *   Manages permissions required by the Device Control module, requesting them from the user transparently.
    *   Secures API keys and sensitive data stored locally.
    *   Implements the mechanism for authorizing other users (details TBD based on user clarification, could involve account linking or temporary tokens).
9.  **Update Mechanism:**
    *   Handles application updates to ensure compatibility with OS updates and deliver new features.
    *   **Standard:** Relies on App Stores (Google Play, Apple App Store) for mobile.
    *   **Custom (Desktop/Optional):** May involve checking a dedicated update server for new versions and managing the download/installation process (requires platform-specific implementation).

## 4. Key Features Implementation Strategy

*   **Self-Development/Adaptation:**
    *   **Preference Learning:** Store interaction patterns and explicit preferences in the Data Management module.
    *   **Knowledge Update:** AI Engine (Online) inherently uses up-to-date information. For specific domains, could implement periodic fetching from trusted sources.
    *   **App Updates:** Implement via the Update Mechanism module.
*   **Offline Functionality:** Core Logic, basic commands (if using offline intent recognition/AI), local Data Management, and UI will work offline. Advanced AI and Cloud Sync require internet.
*   **File Handling:** Utilize Flutter plugins (`file_picker`) for user-initiated file selection. Device Control module for broader (but limited) file system interaction. AI Engine for analyzing text/image content. Video analysis (summarization, transcription) will likely rely on online AI services.
*   **Multi-Platform Control:** Achieved via the Device Control module using Platform Channels. Expectations must be managed regarding the level of control achievable on each platform.

## 5. Technology Stack (Initial)

*   **Framework:** Flutter
*   **Language:** Dart
*   **State Management:** Provider (as in existing code, can be re-evaluated)
*   **Speech:** `speech_to_text`, `flutter_tts`
*   **AI (Online):** HTTP client (`http`) to call Cloud AI APIs (e.g., Gemini API)
*   **AI (Offline):** TBD (e.g., `tflite_flutter`, `onnxruntime` - requires investigation)
*   **Local Storage:** `shared_preferences`, `sqflite`
*   **Cloud Storage:** `googleapis` (for Google Drive), potentially custom HTTP calls.
*   **Platform Integration:** Flutter Platform Channels
*   **Authentication:** `local_auth`

## 6. Next Steps

*   Develop detailed implementation plans for each module and platform.
*   Select specific AI models/APIs.
*   Refine the security model, especially for multi-user authorization.
*   Begin prototyping core modules.
