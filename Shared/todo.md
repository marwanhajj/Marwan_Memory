# Todo List - AI Assistant Development

- [ ] **Step 1: Clarify User Requirements:** Gather detailed requirements from the user regarding AI capabilities, device control, security, offline functionality, cloud storage, and handling of the provided code.
- [X] **Step 2: Analyze Provided Software:** Unzip and examine the structure, dependencies (`pubspec.yaml`), source code (`lib/`), and platform-specific configurations (`android/`, `ios/`, etc.) of the `ai_voice_assistant` project.
- [X] **Step 3: Design Architecture:** Design the overall architecture for the cross-platform AI agent, considering modularity, scalability, platform differences, security, and integration points (AI models, device control APIs, cloud storage).
- [X] **Step 4: Develop Implementation Plans:** Create detailed plans for implementing features on each target platform (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux), including specific APIs or libraries to use.
- [X] **Step 5: Compile and Organize Codebase:** Develop or modify the codebase based on the design and plans, organizing the code into platform-specific folders within a main project directory.
- [ ] **Step 6: Validate Features and Security:** Test the implemented features, including AI responses, device control actions (within limits), security mechanisms, offline capabilities, and file handling.
- [ ] **Step 7: Integrate Cloud & Updates:** Implement Google Drive integration (and potentially others) for memory/preferences and develop a mechanism for application updates.
- [ ] **Step 8: Report and Deliver:** Compile the final project, generate necessary builds or instructions, write a summary report, and deliver the organized project folder to the user.
